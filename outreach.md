        <p>I am deeply immersed in astronomy outreach in Chile. I am an active member of the outreach team at the National Observatory in Cerro Cal√°n, Santiago, where I participate in public tours of the observatory. Additionally, I serve as a Vera Rubin Science Ambassador, working to highlight astronomy to the general public in Chile.</p>
