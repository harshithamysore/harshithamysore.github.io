I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Chile, conducting research under the guidance of Professors Gijs D. Mulders and Simon Cassasus, focusing on exoplanet demographics.

I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Physics from the University of Bangalore.

I have been working on exoplanets all my PhD life, started with the detection of a warm neptune Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) lightcurve and its radial velocity follow up. /n Later I moved on to planet atmospheres where I led my battle against Molecfit and PCA, to analyse one of the closest rocky planet to the sun. I had the oppurtunity to present this work as a poster(ADD LINK HERE TO THE WORD POSTER) in Open Problems in the Astrophysics of Gas Giants (OPAGA) 2023 conference. /n Then, for my actual thesis, I started working on exoplanet demographics, mainly around Low massive stars (MK dwarfs). I am extensivlely using TESS data to look into the planet distributions around these stars.
