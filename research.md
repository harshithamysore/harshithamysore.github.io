I have been working on exoplanets throughout my PhD, focusing on the following areas:

- **Exoplanet Demographics**: Currently, for my thesis, I am focusing on population studies of exoplanets, primarily around low-mass stars (M-dwarfs). I am extensively using TESS data to investigate the distribution of planets around these stars to understand planet formation and evolution around the low massive stars.
  
Project 1: [Exploring the Radius valley amongst the lowest mass stars with TESS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MEk0F76wIJ8uEU8z88GMrIe6KOJH3xrQ/view?usp=sharing)  
  
- **Exoplanet Atmospheres**: I studied planetary atmospheres, under Prof. Patricio Rojo, where I tackled the challenges of Molecfit and PCA to analyze the atmosphere of a rocky exoplanet with a high Transmission Spectroscopy Metric(TSM). I had the opportunity to present this work as a [poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FTNmDSWAXWPaZpwFlldrmOHAJz-9gzum/view?usp=sharing) at the Open Problems in the Astrophysics of Gas Giants (OPAGA) 2023 conference.

- **Exoplanet detections**: I worked under Prof. Andres Jordan and Prof. Rafeal Brahm for a semester with the detection of a warm Neptune using the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) lightcurve and its radial velocity follow-up.
