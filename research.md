I have been working on exoplanets all my PhD life, started with the detection of a warm neptune Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) lightcurve and its radial velocity follow up.

Later I moved on to planet atmospheres where I led my battle against Molecfit and PCA, to analyse one of the closest rocky planet to the sun. I had the oppurtunity to present this work as a [poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FTNmDSWAXWPaZpwFlldrmOHAJz-9gzum/view?usp=sharing) in Open Problems in the Astrophysics of Gas Giants (OPAGA) 2023 conference.

Then, for my actual thesis, I started working on exoplanet demographics, mainly around Low massive stars (MK dwarfs). I am extensivlely using TESS data to look into the planet distributions around these stars.
